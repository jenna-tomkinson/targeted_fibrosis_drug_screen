# ## Update QC metrics for blur to better catch poor quality images
# 
# Using the data from the `cellpainting_predicts_cardiac_fibrosis` repository, the QC thresholds will be updated to better detect poor quality images.
# 
# In the previous experiment, the thresholds were working well in those conditions.
# To apply to this experiment, we will rerun the QC to find optimal thresholds for blur for all channels for only one side of the distribution.
# More negative represents blur, so we only need one threshold to catch these conditions.
# More positive/close to 0 looks to represent empty images but we don't need to catch that condition.
# 
# As well, the QC for saturation has already been updated to have a universal threshold of 0.10 or 10% of pixels can be at the maximum value. 
# This is a stricter threshold that better accounts for the FOVs where cells are growing on top of each other.
